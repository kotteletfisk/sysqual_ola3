## Objective of assignment: 

TODO

## Deliverables: 

### Source code for REST API
We used Javalin to implement a simple REST API - all the code is found [here](src/main/java/com/kfisk).
The application is a simple prototype of a task manager, providing endpoints to cover the basic CRUD operations needed for a task.

### Unit tests, integration tests and HTTP test files
Unit tests and integration tests are found [here](src/test/java/com/kfisk/AppTest.java) and is being tested up against a test SQLite DB, located [here](src/test/java/). The test DB doesn't have any data, as data is initialized on a per test level. The test DB therefore only contains the metadata and schema needed for a Task table reflecting the [Task class](src/main/java/com/kfisk/Task.java).

There is automated endpoint tests located [here](src/test/java/com/kfisk/HTTPEndpointTest.java). These tests also uses the test DB, however for this case the API has been build as a docker image and the tests are the conducted on a closed test environment. So keep in mind a docker installation or docker desktop (for windows) is needed to run these tests.

### Code coverage report, minimum 80% coverage
The Jacoco code coverage report is located [here](documentation/jacocoReport.html).

We managed to get a code coverage of 97% on persistence and business logic, however keep in mind that the testing of API endpoints, configuration and handlers are not included in the report, as those tests are run in a docker container, which Jacoco is not able to track.

### JMeter Test plan and load rest results
The JMeter test plan is located [here](perf-tests/test-plan.jmx) and is boiled down to 4 steps:
1. The test plan wrapper - used for configuring and containing the test plan.
2. Thread Group - used for defining the number of users we are simulating, the ramp up time and how to handle errors.
3. Loop Controller - used for defining how many times we want to loop through requests per user.
4. HTTP Request - used for defining the actual request we want to send to the API.

#### Results of the load test:
Raw results are located [here](perf-tests/results.jtl)

HTML report is located [here](perf-tests/report/index.html)

### Reflection page
The reflection document is found [here](documentation/OLA2_reflection-4.pdf).

### Test plan
The test plan is located [here](documentation/Testplan.pdf), and describes the specific test plan for this project, including the different types of tests, objectives and goals, alongside the tools used.
